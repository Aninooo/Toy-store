          Hi! I’m <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Bryan</span>, and welcome to <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Anino's Toy Collections</span>.
        </p>

        <p style={{
          textAlign: "justify",
          marginLeft: "100px",
          marginRight: "100px",
          fontSize: "15px",
          marginBottom: "20px",
          color: "white"
        }}>
          My journey into collecting started with <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>bootleg toys</span>—mainly because they were more affordable and I just loved having different figures to display. But over time, I realized that <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>authentic</span> figures were something special. Sure, they can be pricier, but the quality, the craftsmanship, and the attention to detail really make them stand out. <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>Authentic</span> pieces are built to last and are much more satisfying to own.
        </p>

        <p style={{
          textAlign: "justify",
          marginLeft: "100px",
          marginRight: "100px",
          fontSize: "15px",
          marginBottom: "20px",
          color: "white"
        }}>
          That’s why everything in my collection here at <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>Anino's Toy Collections</span> is <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>100%</span> <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>authentic</span>. I believe in offering <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>high-quality</span> items at a fair price so that you can enjoy these pieces as much as I do. Whether it’s a rare figurine or a popular one, you can trust that it’s real and worth every penny.
        </p>

        <p style={{
          textAlign: "justify",
          marginLeft: "100px",
          marginRight: "100px",
          fontSize: "15px",
          marginBottom: "20px",
          color: "white"
        }}>
          One thing I always want to be transparent about is the condition of the items. If there’s any damage—whether it’s a <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>loose part</span> (a piece that may have come detached or is no longer tightly secured) or if it’s <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>MIB (Mint in Box)</span> (an item that has never been removed from its original packaging) or <span style={{ color: "#FFBF00" }}>MISB (Mint in Sealed Box)</span> (an item that is still in its factory-sealed packaging)—I’ll make sure to let you know up front. Your satisfaction is important, and I want you to feel confident in what you’re purchasing.
        </p>
